# Vandy-ClassFinder

This project was created during VandyHacks Summer edition by Alex, Claire, and Hadley. 
This chrome extension aims to help Vanderbilt students save time during course registration by telling students what
concentration each class they're looking at falls under for a specified major. 

### To install the Chrome extension:
* Clone the repository onto your local machine into a known directory
* Open a new Google Chrome browser, and navigate to the [extension management page](chrome://extensions)
* In the upper right corner, toggle *Developer Mode*
* Click on the *Load unpacked* button in the upper left corner, and select the extension's directory

### To re-load the extension after making a change:
* Reload the [extension management page](chrome://extensions), and Chrome will reload the extension

### To see the action of the Chrome extension:
* Open a new tab or window!

### Notes
* The all_urls in the manifest.json loads the chrome extension onto every webpage, this will be changed later to only apply to YES.
